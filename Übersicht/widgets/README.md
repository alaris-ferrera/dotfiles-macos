# Widgets

So I have 2 widgets that I use:

- **The Search Bar at the Bottom:**

*In the searchbar.coffee file you can change the size, color, opacity, search engine, and other things.*

#

- **A Last.FM Widget That Shows Your Last Scrobbled Tracks**

(You need to have an last.fm account for this to work.) This by default is draggable, but it can be disabled in the lastfm.coffee file. Also in that same file you need to replace where it says **your_username_here** with your last.fm username in order for it to work.
