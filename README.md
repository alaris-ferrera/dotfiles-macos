# Note  
I don't use a custom WM because I don't really want to disable SIP, because in the past I have disabled it for a while to try out Amythyst (A WM), and when I decided to stop using Amythyst for a while, I deleted it, and re-enabled SIP, but my Mac wouldn't boot, and I had to do a fresh install of macOS.
So I don't want that to happen again.
