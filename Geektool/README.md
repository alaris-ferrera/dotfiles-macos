# Geektool
So each widget I have on my screen is called a "**geeklet**", which is basically just a small script.
Once you download a geeklet (.glet file) you just need to double click on it, and if you have Geektool installed it should prompt you to install it, and then it will be installed. All the settings that I have applied to my widgets should automatically be applied.
